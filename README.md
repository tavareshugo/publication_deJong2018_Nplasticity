# Analysis code for publication de Jong et al. 2018

This repository contains code used in the analysis of data from de Jong et al. 2018.

There are two directories:

* `R` - contains R code in Rmarkdown files
* `docs` - contains rendered html pages from that code, which can be seen at: 
https://tavareshugo.github.io/publication_deJong2018_Nplasticity

All the data used by the scripts is available for download from the Cambridge 
University data repository Appolo. A description of the data is provided there in 
a README file.

The directory structure necessary for the scripts to work is:

```

 |
 |_ data - unzip the data file from the Appolo repository
 |
 |_ scripts - download/clone this repository to a separate directory
```

**todo:** add link to Appolo repository
