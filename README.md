# Analysis code for publication de Jong et al. 2019

**TODO**

* add link to appolo
* add instructions to download data and scripts into the right directory structure

This repository contains code used in the analysis of data from de Jong et al. 2019 
(add link once published...).

Directories:


* `docs` - **TODO**
* `scripts` - contains shell, python and R code to reproduce analysis shown in the paper

Data used by the scripts is available for download from the Cambridge 
University data repository Appolo (**TODO** add DOI link). 
A description of the data is provided there in a README file.

The directory structure necessary for the scripts to work is:

```
project_folder
 |
 |_ data - unzip the data file from the Appolo repository
 |
 |_ data_processed - provided in the Appolo repository or recreated from our code
 |
 |_ scripts - download/clone this repository to a separate directory
```
